Cauldron VTT
============

Cauldron is a free and open source web based virtual tabletop (VTT). With its
generic dice system, you can use it for any rule and combat system you want,
but it has some extra support for systems that use the d20 dice and armor class
for combat, like Dungeons & Dragons and Pathfinder.

You can create a free account at https://www.cauldron-vtt.net/ or host it on
your own server. It's written in PHP and Javascript and uses a MySQL database
to store game information and a websocket for client-to-client communication.
