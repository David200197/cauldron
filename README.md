Cauldron VTT
============

Cauldron is a free and open source web based virtual tabletop (VTT). Although
its main focus is on Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition, you can also use it for
other systems.

You can create a free account at https://www.cauldron-vtt.net/ or host it on
your own server. It's written in PHP and jQuery and uses a MySQL database to
store game information and a websocket for client-to-client communication.
