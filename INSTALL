Installation
============
This application has been built upon the Banshee PHP framework. Use the
following steps to install a Banshee based website.

This application was developed on a Linux system. It will very likely run
well on other Unix clones. Other operating systems are not supported. This
is mainly due to the required websocket server (see below).


Configure your webserver
------------------------
Use the directory 'public' as the webroot (documentroot) directory and allow
PHP execution. Banshee needs URL rewriting. If you use the Hiawatha webserver,
you can use the following configuration:

	UrlToolkit {
		ToolkitID = banshee
		RequestURI isfile Return
		Match ^/(css|files|fonts|images|js)(/|$) Return
		Match ^/(favicon.ico|robots.txt)$ Return
		Match [^?]*(\?.*)? Rewrite /index.php$1
	}

	Directory {
		DirectoryID = files
		Path = /files
		StartFile = index.html
		ShowIndex = yes
		ExecuteCGI = no
	}

	Directory {
		DirectoryID = static
		Path = /css, /fonts, /images, /js
		ExpirePeriod = 2 weeks
	}

	VirtualHost {
		...
		UseToolkit = banshee
		UseDirectory = static, files
	}


For Apache, there is a .htaccess file in the 'public' directory which contains
the required URL rewriting rules. If you use another webserver, you have to
convert the rewriting rules to your webserver's configuration.


File access rights
------------------
Make sure the directory public/files and the subdirectories it contains, are
writable for the webserver.


Configure PHP
-------------
TableTop requires at least PHP v7.2 and needs PHP's JSON, MySQLi, GD and
XML/XSL module. Enable them in your PHP configuration. Also, make sure that
the date.timezone setting has been set correctly.


Configure your database
-----------------------
Open your browser, type in the URL of your website and add /setup to it. Follow
the instructions on your screen to setup your database. After this step,
disable the setup module in settings/public_modules.conf.


Configure Cronjob
-----------------
Configure cronjob to run the script database/backup_database once per day.


Configure Banshee
-----------------
Go to the Settings administration page in Banshee's CMS and replace the present
e-mail addresses with your own. Before going live, remove or comment the setup
module in the file settings/public_modules.conf and set DEBUG_MODE in the file
settings/website.conf to 'no'.


Websocket Server
----------------
This application requires a websocket server. Unpack extra/ws_server.tar.gz and
follow the instructions in the INSTALL file.


Content from other websites
---------------------------
If you plan to use maps (images or videos) from other websites, make sure you
update the HEADER_CSP setting in settings/website.conf.


Upgrading
=========
Before upgrading this website, run database/backup_database make a backup of
your database to disk. Then make a backup of the TableTop directory.
Replace the source code with the new version. Open the website and add
/setup to the URL. Follow the instructions on the screen.
