# Cauldron's basic concept
What Cauldron VTT offers is tokens on a map. The dungeon master can control every token, while players only control the token representing their character. A token can be a player character, a monster, an NPC or an object. A map can be an image, a video or an empty grid on which the dungeon master can draw lines or paint textures. One or more maps that belong together form an adventure.

By drawing constructs (walls, windows and doors) on a map, a dungeon master can limit where players can move their character to and what they can see (fog of war).

Cauldron aims to be a direct replacement of a real tabletop. Use your character sheet, your books and other stuff as you are used to. Cauldron just offers what's needed to play online. This makes Cauldron VTT quickly to learn and easy to use.

If you have any questions or need support, meet me at the Cauldron VTT Discord server.
