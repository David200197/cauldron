# Gathering a party

For your players to join your game, they also need a Cauldron VTT account. For that, you have two options.

You create their accounts yourself. For that, click the Users icon in the DM's Vault.
You set an invitation code and send it to your players. They can use it to join your group while creating an account themselves. To create an invitation code, click the Invite icon in the DM's Vault. When someone creates an account without using an invitation code, (s)he will create a new group and becomes Dungeon Master for that group.
When a player has created an account without an invitation code, [send me a message](http://localhost:8090/contact) with your username and your player's username and I will move the player's account to your group.

When your players have an account, they have to create a character. For that, they need to click on the [Characters](http://localhost:8090/character) link in the main menu bar. When all characters have been created, add them to your adventure via the [Players](http://localhost:8090/vault/players) option in the DM's Vault. Be aware that a character can only be active in one adventure at a time.
